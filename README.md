# Multiverse Clockwork
An openFrameworks project inspired by Clockwork Orange and nihilistic theoretical physics

## Concept
For this creative coding project I wanted imitate the animations that were popular at the time when A Clockwork Orange (1971) was created. During that time, computer graphics first started to emerge. I wanted to create an animation that would encompass the aspects of CG if they were to be applied in the A Clockwork Orange movie, but with the inclusion of a few animations that would convey multiverse theory concepts. The translation of a orange circle came out more literal than the translation of the multiverse concept, this turned out to be in parallel with their comprehensibility. The multiverse theory concepts are influenced by Jim Holt’s book Why Does the World Exist?.

The animation starts with the original ClockWork theme melody which signifies the low complexity of one universe. This part of the animation is very literal. Then as the music progresses into a more progressive form, the animations become more intricate, abstract, and complex. This is an attempt to convey the complexity of multiverse theories which are abstract to our comprehension as are the animations that try to represent them.

The way this coding project was taking its path easily emerged into such a theme and has yielded pretty satisfying results. The code itself is almost 700 lines long which gives it an ironic aspect; it is written in such a fashion that only its creator can understand.This is similar to the way multiverses can be imagined as ideas since we might not be able to comprehend their inner functioning. The way this project was coded should be a challenge for anyone’s understanding.
